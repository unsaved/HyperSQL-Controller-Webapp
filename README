HyperSQL Controller Webapp

This web application is only for deployment in app servers that have
container-managed HyperSQL data sources.  Most app servers do not have
facilities to startup a HyperSQL Listener or to gracefully shut down the
data servers when the app server shuts down.  This app does both of these
things.

The deliverable is the war file "hsqldbController-*.war".  Download the file,
rename it to "hsqldbController.war"  (i.e. remove the version suffix) and
deploy.
Use your container facilities to set a servlet context init parameter and/or
data source resource references to specify whether to run a HyperSQL Listener
and which data sources (or none) to automatically shut down.

Tomcat users should see the sample context file in the doc  directory of this
project.

Users of any application server can use server facilities to set

    + init parameter "hsqldb.server.propertiespath" to the absolute path to
      a HyperSQL Listener properties file

and/or

    + resource references to each data source to auto-shutdown, with JNDI
      names "java:comp/env/hsqldbDsAutostop/1",
      "java:comp/env/hsqldbDsAutostop/2", etc.

OR

    Edit this web app's "web.xml" file according to the instructions to
    accomplish the same thing.
