<!--
     This is a runtime config file for Tomcat.
     If you have no other need to modify this web app, then just copy this
     file into the $CATALINA_BASE/conf/Catalina/localhost directory.
     (Restart Tomcat if it wasn't running.  You can put this file in place
     either before or after deploying the war.)

     Default behavior of these files has changed with Tomcat 7.  To honor
     files in $CATALINA_BASE/conf/Catalina/localhost with Tomcat 7 and later,
     you must add attribute 'copyXML="true"' to your server.xml file (and
     restart Tomcat).

     You can alternatively rebundle the war file with this file moved to
     "/META-INF/context.xml" within the war file.  The contents of that file
     will take precedence.
     In all cases, if you make the corresponding settings in your web.xml,
     these runtime settings will be ignored.
